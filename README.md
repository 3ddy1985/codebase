# CodeBase, a Fullstack Ruby on Rails app - GA Project 4

CodeBase is a social platform for coders to share, learn and connect with other coders. The app is built using Ruby on Rails and uses a PostgreSQL database. The app allows users to sign up, create a profile, add code snippets to their profile, post questions, and engage in conversations.


## Brief
- **Build a full stack web application**. Must be your own work.
- **Select a Project Idea of your own**.
- Have at _least_ 2 models (more if it makes sense)
  - Auth is a **requirement**
- Have full CRUD on at _least_ one of your models
- Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models
- Have high quality code:
    - Follow accepted naming conventions
    - Consistent indentation
    - Well-structured and readable code
    - Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
    - Short and clear functions that _do one thing_
    - Efficient code - if you have your MVP, refactor
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
- **Use one of these technology stacks**. You may choose which tech stack.
  - Full-Stack Rails App
  - Rails API with React Front-End
  - Express API with React Front-End
- Be deployed on Heroku or similar platform
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app**.
- Timeframe - One week

## Features
As I have a limited timescale, I have split the build features into an MVP and additional features. I have done this to make sure I have a fully working CRUD app to present at the end of project week.

### MVP:
- User registration and login
- User profile creation and editing
- Code snippet creation and storage for users
- Basic search functionality for code snippets
- Posting and commenting on questions and code snippets

### Additional features:
- Group & private chat functionality
- Advanced search functionality for questions and code snippets
- Social sharing and follow features for users
- Integration with external APIs to enhance search results


## User Stories:
- As a new user, I want to be able to create an account with a unique username and password so that I can access the features of the app.
- As a user, I want to be able to log in and log out of my account so that I can securely access my saved code snippets and posts.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile with information about myself, such as my name, profile picture, and bio, so that other users can learn more about me.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for questions or code snippets on the app to find information relevant to my coding needs.
- As a user, I want to be able to save code snippets to my profile for my personal reference.
- As a user, I want to be able to add tags or categories to my saved code snippets to make them easier to search for later.
- As a user, I want to be able to view and edit my saved code snippets and profile information at any time.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my saved code snippets and profile information if I no longer need them.
- As a user, I want to be able to create posts with questions or code snippets so that I can share my knowledge and seek help from other users.
- As a user, I want to be able to comment on posts made by other users to provide answers, feedback, or additional information.
- As a user, I want to be able to follow other users and receive notifications when they create new posts or comment on existing ones.
- As a user, I want to be able to receive notifications when someone comments on my posts or replies to my comments.
